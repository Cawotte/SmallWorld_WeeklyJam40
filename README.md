# My first game jam project, Small Islands

The source code of my first Game jam project ! It's a game called "Small Islands" made 
in 4 days with Unity, during mid-april 2018, for the Weekly Game Jam #40 with the theme "Small World".

You can play the game by building it yourself in Unity, or just play it online on the <a href="https://cawotte.itch.io/small-islands">itchi.o page of the game</a>!

# The team
We were 3 people to work on the game :
- Me, Cawotte, I programmed the whole game, incorporated the assets, realized the game design and level design.
- Gardrek, an artist who did the pixel-art assets.
- Sunmachine, Sound designer, who made the music and SFX.

 # Big Refactor
 
 As of February 2020, I fully refactored the code of the game. 
 
 It means that the project is now compatible with Unity 2019.2 instead of 2017.3. It also means that the code
 is not the full mess it previously was. It had so much code gore I wonder how that repository managed to get 11 stars
 in the first place.
