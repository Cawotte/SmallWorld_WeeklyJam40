# My first game jam project, Small Islands

The source code of my first Game jam project ! It's a game called "Small Islands" made 
in 4 days with Unity, during mid-april 2018, for the Weekly Game Jam #40 with the theme "Small World".

You can play the game by downloading in the release folder the build corresponding to your OS (It's available Windows, Linux, and Mac)
or just go on the <a href="https://cawotte.itch.io/small-islands">itchi.o page of the game</a>
 to directly play it in browser or download the already zipped folders !

# The team
We made the game as a team of 3 people
- Me, I programmed the entirety of the game and did the game design and level design.
- Gardrek, a 2D Artist who made the graphics
- Sunmachine, Sound designer, who's the music and SFX.

# About the code
Most of the code is commented.
<br/>There's some scripts or tools that are not from me though : 
  - DSPixelPerfectCamera.cs, <a href="https://github.com/cmilr/DeadSimple-Pixel-Perfect-Camera">It's from this repository</a>, I used it to easily make the camera have a pixel perfect rendering. 
  - TextMeshPro, it's a free asset on the Unity store to improve the UI with more personalizable Text panels for example.
  - Tools for Tilemap, <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/2d-extras">from Unity2D-extras</a>, that allowed me to easily setup random tiles, animated tiles, and ruled tiles.
